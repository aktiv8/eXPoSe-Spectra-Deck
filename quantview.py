"""What the desktop Quantification tab lets the user change, without Tk
(``quant_ui.QuantPanel`` draws it): which fitted regions count, whether the
transmission function is divided out, which depth level is shown and how a
depth profile is drawn.

``resultspages.collect`` decides what counts *by default* (a region fitted in
several spectra counts once, an element with a known standard line counts
that line) and stores it on each ``Level``. The user's ticks are kept apart in
a ``ViewState`` -- an absent key means "the default" -- and ``effective``
re-runs ``quant.normalise`` on a copy of the level, so the report's own
numbers are never touched. Ticking a region the report leaves out is allowed,
as on the HTML page (``viewer.js`` ``renderFitQuant``); the panel marks every
row whose tick differs from the default (``changed``).

Every number comes from ``quant`` / ``resultspages``; nothing is computed here.
