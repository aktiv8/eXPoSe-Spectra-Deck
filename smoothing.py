"""Spectrum smoothing for display only (never applied to the data a reader
returns, an export, or a fit). Tk-free; numpy is imported inside the
functions so importing this module costs nothing extra.

Three methods, all numpy-only (no scipy dependency):

* ``savitzky_golay`` — local least-squares polynomial smoothing, the
  standard method in the field.
* ``fourier_lowpass`` — a simple smooth (super-Gaussian) roll-off applied to
  the real FFT, with ``auto_cutoff`` finding the knee between signal and
  noise floor in the log-magnitude spectrum. Both work on the trace minus
  its first-to-last-point line, which is added back afterwards.
* ``gauss_hermite_smooth`` — the actual order-4 Gauss-Hermite filter (a
  faithful port of "Gauss Hermite filter code 2024 Jan.pdf": originally
  written by Long Le Van and David Apsnes, edited by BYU students Kristopher
  Wright and Alvaro J. Lizarbe). Unlike ``fourier_lowpass``, its transfer
  function really is built from a truncated Hermite/Gaussian series, and it
  first removes a line + parabola trend (fitted from the high-frequency,
  noise-only Fourier coefficients) before filtering, so a sloping background
  doesn't ring at the ends of the window the way a bare FFT low-pass can.

``smooth(y, method, strength)`` maps one 0-1 knob onto whichever method's own
parameter, for a single UI control.
