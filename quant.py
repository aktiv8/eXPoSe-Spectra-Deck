"""Quantification from CasaXPS fits (Tk-free; numpy only to evaluate).

What is recorded is what is used: the areas and RSFs are CasaXPS's own numbers
(read from the VAMAS ``CASA region`` / ``CASA comp`` lines by ``casafit``), the
background comes from ``casafit.curves``. Nothing is guessed: a region with no
RSF or no area is left out and says why.

Areas are in counts/s x eV: intensity is divided by dwell x scans, the same
scale ``casafit`` uses for the stored component areas (checked: the integral of
each reconstructed component equals its stored area).

``fit_rows(region)`` gives one row (a JSON-ready dict) per distinct fit region
of a *display* region (binding-energy shift applied, so positions are in the
frame that is drawn); ``normalise`` turns rows into atomic percent and
``states`` splits an element by chemical state (components sharing an INDEX are
one state; the others stand alone).

Region area = integral of (data - background) over the region, in raw kinetic
energy, as CasaXPS reports it. Where the background type is not reproduced the
sum of the component areas is used instead and the row says so (``basis``).

    ``casa_why``. ``include`` is an optional list of booleans (default: all);
    ``transmission`` divides the transmission function out where the row has

    real recorded one).

    A row's own recorded RSF (``row["rsf"]``) is used first, exactly as

    order, before giving up with ``why = "no RSF"``:

    1. **Each component's own RSF** (``rsf_source = "component"``): a
       KherveFitting-derived fit can carry a different, individually
       cross-referenced RSF per component (a doublet's two members are
       physically distinct lines, unlike CasaXPS's convention of one RSF for
       the whole region) -- ``sum(area_i / rsf_i)`` over the components that
       have one, in place of ``area / rsf``. Numerically a no-op for a
       region whose components all share the region's own (falsy) RSF, so
       this changes nothing for a plain CasaXPS file.
    2. **A reference-table lookup** (``rsf_table``, a list from
       ``rsf.load_rsf()``; ``rsf_library`` picks which one, default
       "scofield") -- **off by default** (``rsf_table=None``), the same
       "nothing is guessed" stance this module already takes on a missing
       RSF: only tried when a caller explicitly supplies a table. Looked up
       by the row's own region name and photon energy via ``rsf.rsf_of``;
       when found, ``rsf_source``/``rsf_anode``/``rsf_value`` record exactly
       which library/anode/number was substituted. ``rsf_library``
       ``"scofield_tpp2m"``/``"scofield_ke06"`` look up the base "scofield"
       value the same way, then multiply it by a kinetic-energy-dependent
       factor from ``imfp.py`` (``imfp_nm``/``ke_power_factor``, computed
       from the row's own ``be_lo``/``be_hi``/``photon_energy`` --
       ``res["imfp_nm"]``/``res["ke_power_factor"]`` record which) --
       **never** applied to a real recorded RSF or to the Kratos Axis F1s
       library, both empirical values with their own implicit kinetic-
       energy dependence already baked in (see ``imfp.py``'s own
       docstring). When TPP-2M's own kinetic energy is outside its stated
