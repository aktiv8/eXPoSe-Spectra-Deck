r"""Line shapes and backgrounds for reconstructing CasaXPS fits.

All curves are computed on an **ascending kinetic-energy grid** (the frame in
which CasaXPS stores positions) and scaled to the stored *area* (intensity
integrated over energy).

* ``GL(m)``  product Gaussian/Lorentzian, ``m`` = % Lorentzian
* ``SGL(m)`` sum Gaussian/Lorentzian
* ``LA(a,b,m)`` (also ``LA(a,m)`` = ``LA(a,a,m)``, or ``LA(m)``) asymmetric
  Lorentzian, Gaussian-broadened
* ``LF(a,b,w,m)`` as LA with a finite tail of width ``w``

GL and SGL are exact. **LA and LF are reconstructions**: their Gaussian
broadening scale is still an empirical calibration (below), but the base
kernel itself is no longer a third-party guess -- CasaXPS's own *Cookbook*
(Casa Software Ltd., 2026, pp.65-66) gives ``LA(x: alpha,beta,w) = N *
INTEGRAL(lg(tau; alpha,beta) * g(x-tau; w) dtau)`` with ``lg(x: alpha,beta)
= l(x)**alpha`` for ``x <= 0`` and ``l(x)**beta`` for ``x > 0`` -- matching
this module's formula exactly, and matching the independent third-party
write-up this was originally reconstructed from (Major et al., *Surf.
Interface Anal.* 53 (2021) 689, Eq. 6; Major, Shah, Fernandez, Fairley (Casa
Software Ltd.) and Linford, *Vacuum Technology & Coating*, March 2020,
Eq. 3). The Gaussian broadening's own scale was calibrated on real CasaXPS
fits (``tests/`` and the validation notes in the README give the residuals).
The stored areas, positions and widths are CasaXPS's own numbers.

**The shared Lorentzian width.** Raising a Lorentzian to a power ``p != 1``
shrinks its own half-max distance by ``sqrt(2**(1/p) - 1)`` relative to
``p = 1``, so using the file's ``fwhm`` unscaled as each side's own width (as
this module did before) makes a strongly asymmetric component (e.g.
``LA(1.2,5,8)``, CasaXPS's sharp metallic-tail cutoff) reconstruct far too
tall for its stored area -- confirmed on two independent real files
(titanium and vanadium metallic-tail examples in ``tests/``), the
reconstructed peak standing up to ~10-18 % of the peak height above the raw
data at the component's own maximum, hidden by ``residual_rms`` because that
metric averages over the whole curve. The fix (from KherveFitting's own
``LA``/``LAxG`` implementation, ``libraries/Peak_Functions.py``,
github.com/KherveFitting/KherveFitting, retrieved 2026-09-25) is **one
Lorentzian width shared by both sides**, chosen so the two sides' own
half-max distances add up to the stored ``fwhm`` (not each side independently
reproducing it, which was tried first and made CasaXPS's own worked LA
examples with mild asymmetry measurably worse while helping the severe
cases): ``F = 2*fwhm / (sqrt(2**(1/a)-1) + sqrt(2**(1/b)-1))``, which is
exactly ``fwhm`` for an unmodified Lorentzian (``a == b == 1``) -- the GL/SGL
shapes and the 2-argument ``LA(m)``/``LF(...)`` shorthand (which default
``a`` and ``b`` to 1) are unaffected; a symmetric but non-unity pair (e.g.
``LA(2,2,m)``) is rescaled too, since raising *either* side to a power other
than 1 narrows it the same way.
Checked against every real ``LA``/``LF``-fitted file available (titanium,
copper, both vanadium exports, MXene): titanium's worst-case overshoot fell
from 18.3 % to 8.7 %, this file's vanadium example from 9.85 % to 4.70 %, and
6 of MXene's 8 affected regions improved too (the other 2 regressed by under
one percentage point). ``TestLAAsymmetryAccuracy`` in ``tests/test_casafit.py``
is a canary against this getting worse.

**The 1-argument ``LA(m)`` shorthand is not ``LA(1,1,m)``.** Every finding
above this paragraph, and two rejected leads that used to be recorded here
(a "corrected direction" retune, and a claim that no ``GAUSS_K`` can round out
a symmetric ``LA(m)`` component's own apex), were all tested by feeding the
shorthand's ``m`` (0-100) straight into the same formula the explicit
``LA(a,b,m)`` form uses -- which is wrong. CasaXPS's own definition (Fairley
et al., "Practical guide to understanding goodness-of-fit metrics ... using
nylon as an example," *J. Vac. Sci. Technol. A* 41(1) 2023, supplementary
information, Eq. 4-6; also *Cookbook* 2026 p.19, Figure 15's caption) is
``LA(x: alpha,beta,n) = N * INTEGRAL(lg(tau; alpha,beta) * g(x-tau; f_G(n))
dtau)`` (a generalised Lorentzian convolved with a Gaussian whose width is
controlled by ``n``) and, separately, ``LA(x,m) = LA(x: 1,1, 1401 -
(m/100)*1401)``: the shorthand's ``m`` and the explicit form's ``n`` run in
**opposite directions** (``LA(0)`` -> ``n = 1401``, ``LA(100)`` -> ``n =
0``), not the same variable. ``parse_shape`` used to set ``m = ps[0]`` for
the shorthand directly; it now applies this conversion, so every real
``LA(m)``-shorthand file (PET's ``LA(50)`` among them) is now evaluated at
its true ``n = 1401 - 14.01*m``, and the explicit 3-argument form is
unaffected (it was already using ``n`` correctly).

**The 2-argument ``LA(a,n)`` form is a separate case, and was not
distinguished from the 1-argument shorthand above at all** -- a second,
independent bug, found while reading the *Cookbook* itself (2026 p.66):
*"Abbreviation for LA lineshape: LA(x: alpha, w) = LA(x: alpha, alpha, w)"*
-- ``b`` is implicitly ``a`` (a symmetric-but-non-unity Lorentzian power),
and the trailing number is the explicit form's own ``n``, used directly --
*not* run through the 1-argument shorthand's ``m``-to-``n`` conversion
above. ``parse_shape`` used to fall into the same ``else`` branch as the
1-argument case for *any* fewer-than-3-argument string, taking only
``ps[0]`` through the wrong (1-argument) formula regardless of whether a
second number was present at all -- so a real ``LA(1.53,243)`` file was
silently evaluated as ``a=b=1, n=1401-14.01*1.53 approx 1380`` instead of
the correct ``a=b=1.53, n=243``, both the exponent and the Gaussian width
wrong.
Confirmed on the one real file with this form found across the full local
corpus (~700 files, ``D:\Temp`` and ``~\Downloads``):
``~\Downloads\assigned.vms``, a 5-sample Mo 3d/S 2s fit (MoS2/MoO2/MoO3/WS2
mixed system, ~10 ``LA(1.53,243)`` components per region). Comparing
``casafit.curves()``'s reconstruction against this file's own raw data,
before/after the fix, ``residual_rms`` / ``chi2_red`` per region:
``RW_WS2_MoS2_thicker`` 8.86% / 139.3 -> 5.32% / 54.9,
``RW_Tha_MoS2`` 7.23% / 930.2 -> 3.98% / 329.8,
``RW_sonic_MoS2`` 7.73% / 2339.2 -> 4.39% / 917.5,
``RW_WS2_MoS2`` 8.59% / 129.8 -> 5.38% / 52.6,
``RW_Nb_MoS2`` 10.81% / 455.3 -> 6.84% / 209.7 -- both metrics roughly halve
across every region.

This was found the same way the ``DS`` calibration below was: two new
synthetic files built specifically to sweep ``m`` in a controlled way against
one shared raw peak, with the components' FWHM deliberately linked equal so
it is the only free parameter left to compensate for a "wrong" ``m`` --
``D:\Temp\for claude files\synthetic PMMA.vms`` (``LA(m)`` shorthand, ``m =
0..100``, 11 CasaXPS refits) and ``D:\Temp\for claude files\synthetic PMMA.
3 param LAvms.vms`` (explicit ``LA(1,1,m)``, ``m = 1000..0``), both refitting
the same raw data. Comparing the reconstructed envelope to the raw data
directly does not work on this pair (their components' stored ``Area`` is
~100-450x too small for the data's actual peak height -- an unrelated
data-quality artifact of the file, not a shape question); instead, since FWHM
is the fit's only free width parameter, how the reported (linked) FWHM must
drift as ``m`` sweeps -- via the standard pseudo-Voigt width approximation,
``FWHM_V = 0.5346*FWHM_L + sqrt(0.2166*FWHM_L**2 + FWHM_G**2)`` -- is a clean
signature of the true broadening-vs-``m`` relationship: the correct ``(K, P)``
should make the implied total width stay constant across the whole sweep,
since it is the same underlying peak throughout. Feeding both files' raw
``m`` into one formula gave opposite-signed answers (this is what surfaced
the shorthand/explicit scale bug above); on the corrected, unified ``n``
scale, a joint fit -- minimising that width-consistency spread (today's
formula: 8.9 % coefficient of variation across the 21-point sweep) while
never letting any real ``LA``/``LF``-fitted region in the existing corpus get
more than ~0.25 percentage points worse than it already was -- converges on
``GAUSS_K["LA"] = 0.41``, ``GAUSS_P["LA"] = 0.60`` (replacing ``0.20`` and an
implicit exponent of 1; used the same way ``GAUSS_P["DS"]`` already is,
below), bringing the sweep's spread down to ~7.9 %. **The real corpus this
was checked against is bigger than the "six real fits" this constant was
first calibrated on**, and bigger than what the earlier "not adopted"
attempts above were checked against: 25 ``LA``/``LF``-fitted regions across 7
files (titanium `fitting example` and the `Metal Depth Profile` instructors'
file -- the latter has both a clean 2-component metal region and an
8-component mixed metal+oxide region in one file, the busiest region in the
corpus and the one that ruled out a more aggressive retune tried first --
copper, vanadium (both the plain and `For Instructors` exports), two MXene
files, PET). Measured effect: titanium `fitting example`'s worst-case
overshoot (the number the old ``TestLAAsymmetryAccuracy`` ceiling comment was
built around) falls from 8.70 % to 6.27 %; every other region in the corpus
moves by at most ~0.24 percentage points either way; PET's shorthand
``LA(50)`` component (now correctly ``n = 700.5``, not ``50``) moves its
C 1s/O 1s overshoot by ~0.02 pp. The worst case across the whole corpus stays
PET's O 1s, 9.46 % to 9.43 % (very slightly better). Do not retune
``GAUSS_K``/``GAUSS_P`` again without new evidence beyond what produced this
result -- but do re-run this comparison (this file's own module docstring
here, and ``TestLAAsymmetryAccuracy``/``TestPETFile``/``TestLASweepShape``)
before touching either constant, since the previous two "not adopted"
conclusions in this file were reached on a mis-scaled ``m`` and turned out to
be wrong, and a first attempt at this same retune (``K=0.90, P=0.80``, fit
only against a 5-file subset of the corpus) passed every test available at
the time but pushed the `Metal Depth Profile` file's 8-component region's
overshoot from 8.8 % to 16.3 % -- always check the *busiest*, most
overlapping real region available, not just the cleanest ones.

**The 1-argument ``LA(m)`` shorthand's residual overshoot is not a
``GAUSS_K``/``GAUSS_P`` calibration gap -- it is intrinsic to ``a=b=1`` and
cannot be tuned away.** Checked directly against real data, not a synthetic
sweep, thanks to a file built specifically for the comparison:
``D:\Temp\for claude files\PtCl2_new\PtCl2_refitted.vms`` refits the *same*
Cl 2p / Pt 4d / Pt 4f data twice -- once with the shorthand (``LA(70)``,
``LA(90)``), once with the explicit form (``LA(1.52,43)``, ``LA(1.2,43)``) --
so the two reconstructions can be measured against the same raw counts.
Sweeping ``GAUSS_K["LA"]`` from today's ``0.41`` down to ``0`` (no Gaussian
broadening at all -- a bare, unconvolved ``a=b=1`` Lorentzian) moves the
shorthand's overshoot by well under half a percentage point (Cl 2p 4.51% ->
4.50%, Pt 4d 4.82% -> 4.79%, Pt 4f 4.42% -> 4.32%): the convolution width is
not the cause. Printing the residual point by point shows two distinct
effects. First, a slow, low-level excess that persists tens of eV past the
peak (e.g. Pt 4f's high-BE tail, ~700-1800 counts above a ~7000-count flat
continuum from BE 78-88 eV) -- but this is present, at similar magnitude, in
the *explicit*-form reconstruction of the same data too (which plots well),
so it is a generic property of summing large-area Lorentzian tails, not
something specific to the shorthand. Second, and the larger effect: a
**valley-bridging excess between the doublet's two main components**
(Pt 4f's biggest single residual, ~2200 counts on a ~50000-count peak, sits
in the dip between the two spin-orbit lines, not in either peak's own tail).
Raising a Lorentzian's power above 1 narrows it and suppresses exactly this
kind of inter-peak bridging (this is the whole reason the explicit
``LA(1.2,43)``/``LA(1.52,43)`` refit of the same components measures lower
overshoot, 3.49%/2.70%, than the ``a=b=1`` shorthand's 4.42%/4.51%) -- but
CasaXPS's own shorthand definition (Fairley et al. 2023, *Cookbook* 2026, both
cited above) is ``a=b=1`` by construction, so there is no calibration
constant that can narrow it without changing what ``LA(m)`` means. **Do not
retune ``GAUSS_K``/``GAUSS_P`` to chase this again without evidence beyond
what produced this result** (the sweep above already covers the full range
either constant could plausibly take).

**The LF finite tail was reconstructed with the wrong functional form
entirely -- found and fixed from a primary source, not a retune.** The two
"tried and rejected" investigations that used to be recorded in this
paragraph (a polynomial ``(1 - r^2)^2`` hard cutoff at ``r = |x-pos|/fwhm/w``,
and a same-shaped logistic-sigmoid alternative from a third-party
reconstruction) were both variations on the same wrong idea: a taper
*multiplying* the plain ``LA(a,b)`` curve down to (or towards) zero at some
radius. Both failed for the same reason -- ``component_curve`` rescales a
component so its analytic integral equals CasaXPS's stored area
(``test_a_narrow_window_does_not_inflate_the_peak`` protects this), so any
tail removed by a multiplicative taper has to come back as extra height at
the peak. The actual formula, confirmed directly from CasaXPS's own primary
description with runnable reference code -- Major, Shah, Avval, Fernandez,
Fairley, Linford, "Advanced Line Shapes in X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
II. The Finite Lorentzian (LF) Line Shape" (with MATLAB code), *Vacuum
Technology & Coating*, April 2020, cross-checked against Part I (the same
authors, March 2020, which independently confirms the plain ``LA(alpha,beta)``
equation and its exponent-side convention -- low-KE side -> alpha, high-KE
side -> beta -- exactly matching this module's ``t < 0 -> a`` split) -- is
not a taper on the *curve* at all: it is a smoothly *varying exponent*.
``ex(x) = 3.0 - (3.0 - a) / (1 + 4*((x-pos)/w)**2)`` on the low-KE side (and
the analogous expression with ``b`` on the high-KE side), with the base
Lorentzian raised to ``ex(x)`` instead of a fixed ``a``/``b``: at ``x = pos``,
``ex = a`` (unchanged); as ``|x-pos|`` grows past ``w`` (used directly, in
eV -- **not** scaled by ``fwhm``, unlike the removed taper), ``ex`` rises
towards a fixed ceiling of ``3.0`` (a value the source states outright, not a
fitted constant), so the tail decays by an ever-steeper power law rather than
being clipped to exactly zero. The source's own reference code also uses the
base Lorentzian's width as a plain, fixed ``F`` (``F = 1; %peak width``, used
directly, with no rescaling formula given anywhere in either article) --
implemented here as plain ``fwhm``, not the ``_shared_width`` rescale plain
``LA`` uses (checked separately: removing ``_shared_width`` from plain,
explicit ``LA(a,b,n)`` -- no ``w`` -- regresses badly on the wider corpus,
e.g. ``assigned.vms``'s W 4f overshoot jumping from 4.6% to 54%, so that fix
stays; it is specifically the ``w>0`` LF branch that had the wrong mechanism).
Checked against every real ``LF``-fitted region available (5, across
``Titanium Metal Depth Profile - INSTRUCTORS.vms``'s Ti 2p and
``D:\Temp\for claude files\PtCl2\PtCl2_quantified.vms``'s Cl 2p / Pt 4d /
Pt 4f x2): ``residual_rms`` improves on every single region, substantially --
Pt 4d 0.1499 -> 0.0686 (more than halved), Ti 2p 0.0410 -> 0.0307, Cl 2p
0.0629 -> 0.0523, Pt 4f 0.0592 -> 0.0491, Pt 4f (area2) 0.0718 -> 0.0607.
Overshoot (a single worst-point metric, unlike ``residual_rms``'s whole-curve
average) moves in mixed directions region to region -- expected, and not a
sign the fix is wrong, since a better whole-curve fit can still have a
slightly different single peak excursion. The tail's visible extent in
``plots.draw_fit`` (``_COMPONENT_VISIBLE_FLOOR``) is unaffected -- still a
display choice, not a change to the shape or its stored area.

One further real form was found but not adopted: ``PtCl2_quantified.vms``'s
Pt 4d region uses a genuine 5-argument string, ``LF(0.5,0.6,45,180,1)`` /
``LF(0.5,0.6,45,180,3)`` -- a 5th number ``parse_shape`` still drops. The
obvious guess (the 5th number overrides the ``3.0`` ceiling per component)
was tried and made the reconstruction measurably worse (``residual_rms``
0.069 -> 0.091), so it is wrong; the 5th argument is left unreconstructed and
honestly unflagged rather than guessed again, the same precedent as this
module's other "not enough evidence" cases (``QF``, ``H``/``F``, the Tougaard
region line's unused leading numbers).

**A(a,b,n)GL(m) / A(a,b,n)SGL(m): the Gelius asymmetric shape.** Sourced
from CasaXPS's own "Peak Fitting in XPS" (Casa Software Ltd, 2006, p.20 --
read directly, not via a third party): a symmetric ``GL(m)``/``SGL(m)`` base
plus a one-sided tail on the low-KE (high binding energy) side,
``A(x) = base(x) + w(a,b)*[AW(x) - G0(x)]`` for ``x`` below the position,
plain ``base(x)`` above it, where ``w(a,b) = b*(0.7 + 0.3/(a+0.01))``,
``AW(x) = exp(-(u/(fwhm + a*u))**2)`` with ``u = 2*sqrt(ln2)*|x-pos|``, and
``G0`` the plain Gaussian of the same ``fwhm`` (``AW`` at ``a = 0``). This
independent reading matches KherveFitting's own ``A_GL``/``A_SGL``
(``Peak_Functions.py``, retrieved 2026-09-27), which cites the same primary
source and, once its own BE-ascending axis is un-mirrored back to this
module's ascending-KE grid, is algebraically identical -- good agreement
between an independent derivation and a third party's, from the same source.

**The tail term does not always decay to zero.** ``AW(x) - G0(x)`` approaches
a nonzero plateau ``w*exp(-1/a**2)`` as ``x`` moves far from the peak
(confirmed both analytically and numerically), rather than the power-law
decay every other reconstructed shape here has -- CasaXPS's own whitepaper
warns of exactly this ("intensity from the nominal ... region ... can cause
... to move beyond the region defining the background ... not suitable for
quantification without intensity calibration"). For small ``a`` (the one
real value seen anywhere, in the whitepaper's own worked poly(propylene)
example, ``A(0.15,0.7,20)SGL(12)``, is ``0.15``) the plateau is negligible
(``exp(-1/0.15**2)`` ~ 1e-19) and ``component_curve``'s wide-grid area
normalisation is unaffected; a fit using a much larger ``a`` would make that
normalisation window-dependent and unreliable. Not guarded against here --
no real file with a large ``a`` has been seen to know whether CasaXPS's own
usage ever goes there.

**The Gaussian convolution width (the shape string's ``n``, 0-499) is
uncalibrated.** The primary source's own formula has no ``n`` in it at all
(a separate line says only that the shape is "convoluted with a Gaussian
with width characterized by an integer 0 <= n <= 499", the same phrasing
used for ``DS``); lacking a real ``A``/``SGL``-Gelius-fitted file anywhere in
the available corpora (checked: the Brazil Training Course, both Avantage/
Kratos reference sets, the CasaXPS VAMAS corpus and the MXene/PET files all
have zero components using this shape), ``GAUSS_K["A"]`` and
``GAUSS_P["A"]`` are left at the same neutral ``(25/n)**1`` reference point
DS/LA already use (``K = 1.0, P = 1.0`` -- i.e. ``gw = fwhm`` at ``n = 25``),
not a calibrated value. Retune when a real fitted file becomes available,
the same way DS's own calibration was redone once real ``(a, n)`` coverage
appeared.

**TLA: formula and parameter order now confirmed from a primary source; the
Gaussian-convolution calibration is not.** Originally implemented (flagged,
at the user's explicit direction) from KherveFitting's own reconstruction
alone (``Peak_Functions.py``, ``TLA``/``_tla_unit_profile``/
``_tla_width_scale``), which itself cited an unlocatable "CasaXPS Cookbook
(2026), Line shapes section" -- no way at the time to cross-check it against
a primary CasaXPS source, the same "third party might be wrong" risk the
``LA(m)`` shorthand bug above was a cautionary tale about. That Cookbook has
since been located (Casa Software Ltd., 2026, p.66) and checked term by
term: ``TLA(x: alpha,mu,w) = N * INTEGRAL(T(tau; alpha,mu) * g(x-tau; w)
dtau)``, ``T(x: alpha,mu) = [1/(1+4x^2)]**alpha * [pi/2 - atan(2x) + pi/mu]``
for ``mu > 0, alpha > 0`` -- an exact match to this module's own
``_tla_values`` (Lorentzian raised to ``alpha`` = ``sp["a"]``, modulated by
the same arctangent tail factor with ``mu`` = ``sp["b"]``, larger ``mu`` =
weaker asymmetry), **and** confirms the shape string's parameter order is
``TLA(alpha, mu, n)`` as this module already assumed (KherveFitting's own
function signature groups ``(mu, wg, alpha)`` for its *fitting grid
columns* only, which said nothing about the on-disk string's own order --
this was a guess that turned out right, not something the Cookbook itself
was needed to get the code working, but it removes the doubt). What the
Cookbook does *not* give is a numeric Gaussian-convolution width: the width
``w``/``n`` has no closed form connecting the shape string's ``0-499`` code
to an actual eV width for a given ``fwhm``, so ``GAUSS_K["TLA"] =
GAUSS_P["TLA"] = 1.0`` remains the same neutral, uncalibrated reference
point DS/``A`` above use (``gw = fwhm`` at ``n = 25``) -- retune only when a
real ``TLA``-fitted file becomes available, the same way DS's and the
2-argument ``LA`` bug above were. ``_tla_width_scale`` measuring the base
shape's FWHM numerically (no closed form exists for that either) is
unaffected by any of this. Until a real file calibrates the convolution
width, treat a ``TLA``-reconstructed component's overall breadth as
illustrative even though its underlying asymmetric-Lorentzian shape and
parameter order are now on solid ground.

**Tail suffix -- formula now known, still unvalidated.** CasaXPS also lets a
``GL``/``SGL`` shape string carry a trailing ``T(k)`` tail modifier
(``GL(30)T(1.5)``), used for asymmetric metallic peaks. ``parse_shape``
recognises and strips this suffix so the base shape's own parameters parse
correctly, but the tail itself is not reconstructed. Unlike when this was
first written, the formula is no longer unpublished: the *Cookbook* (2026,
p.67) gives it in full -- ``E(x: j,k) = j*exp(k*x)`` for ``x < 0`` else
``0``, and ``SGL(x,m,n)T(k) = (SGL(x,m) + (1-SGL(x,m))*E(x: 1,k)) * G(n)``
(``T(k)`` is the ``j=1`` case of a more general ``PHI(j,k)``; ``GL`` has the
same two variants). The Cookbook also documents two further mechanisms not
implemented here: a general ``ST(mu,gamma)`` asymmetry prefix applicable to
*any* line shape (p.66: ``S(mu)F(x) = N*F(x)*[INTEGRAL(F(phi)dphi, x, inf) +
A/mu]``, ``ST(mu,gamma)F(x) = S(mu)F convolved with a Gaussian of width
gamma`` -- distinct from both ``T(k)``/``PHI(j,k)`` above and the Gelius
``A(a,b,n)`` shape below), and a plain 3-argument extension of ``GL``/
``SGL`` themselves, ``GL(x,m,n) = GL(x,m) * G(n)`` (p.67) -- a second
Gaussian convolution on top of the base pseudo-Voigt that this module's own
``GL``/``SGL``/``VOIGT`` branch of ``parse_shape`` would today silently
truncate to plain ``GL(m)``, reading only ``ps[0]``, if a string like that
ever appeared. None of ``PHI(j,k)``, ``ST(mu,gamma)``, or a 2-argument
``GL(m,n)``/``SGL(m,n)`` turned up anywhere in the ~700-file local corpus
scan that found the real 2-argument ``LA`` file above, nor in any of the
individually-named real files elsewhere in this module -- so none of those
three is implemented; an affected component still draws as its plain base
shape and is flagged ``approximate`` by ``is_exact`` (honestly
unreconstructed, the same treatment ``QF``/``H``/``F`` get below), rather
than silently wrong.

**``GL(m)T(k)`` / ``SGL(m)T(k)`` is now drawn** (``_raw_values``): the
Cookbook formula above for a one-argument shape, no Gaussian convolution,
with ``x`` in units of the component's FWHM and ``x < 0`` the low-KE
(high-binding-energy) side, ``F = base + (1 - base) * exp(k x)`` there and
the plain base above the position, so it is the base peak with an
exponential tail added on the high-BE side (continuous at the position,
larger ``k`` fades faster). **Evidence, honestly:** the formula is
Casa's own (Cookbook p.67), and HarwellXPS's Lineshape Tester (Armoury 0.9.5,
read as text only, never run) independently implements ``GL(m)T(k)`` as "GL
with an exponential tail on the high binding energy side; larger k fades
faster" and says it measured it against Casa's own curves on ``GL(m)`` only
(1 Oct 2026), not on other shapes. **No real CasaXPS fit that uses a ``T(k)``
shape is known on disk here**, so nothing in this repository has checked the
curve against a Casa one: ``is_exact`` stays False and the fit is flagged
approximate, and a ``T()`` on any shape but ``GL``/``SGL`` is still drawn as
the plain base.

**LF's ``w`` is in eV, not in line widths (checked, rejected).** The tester's
help text says LF's tails "steepen beyond about w line widths", while this
module takes ``w`` in eV straight from the MATLAB listing (whose own ``F`` is
1, so the two readings only coincide at FWHM = 1). Tested on every real LF
region (5: Ti 2p of the titanium depth profile; Cl 2p, Pt 4d and Pt 4f x2 of
PtCl2_quantified), evaluating ``w * fwhm`` instead of ``w``: ``residual_rms``
got **worse on all five** (Ti 2p 0.0303 -> 0.0312, Cl 2p 0.0523 -> 0.0539,
Pt 4d 0.0686 -> 0.1401, Pt 4f 0.0491 -> 0.0530, Pt 4f area2 0.0607 ->
0.0652), so ``w`` stays in eV and the tester's wording is loose.

**Invalid parameters** (``check_shape``): the tester refuses shapes with
non-finite numbers, LA exponents <= 0 or a negative Gaussian index, a negative
LF ``m``, a DS asymmetry outside [0, 1) or a negative ``n``, and a ``T(k)``
with ``k <= 0``; ``check_shape`` reports the same (plus a few from the
Cookbook's own ranges) and ``casafit.curves`` leaves such a component out of
the envelope and says so, rather than drawing whatever the arithmetic gives.

**Unrecognised shape names.** A shape name CasaXPS writes that this module
does not implement (``QF``, or CasaXPS's own undocumented ``H``/``F``
families -- seen, unreconstructed, on a real file with three refits of one
C 1s region: ``H(0.09,250)SGL(90)`` and ``F(0.09,32,150)SGL(90)`` alongside
the ``DS`` fit below) used to be silently coerced into an exact ``GL(mix)``
using its first numeric token as a 0-100 % mix -- for ``DS(0.09,500)`` (see
below) this drew an almost-pure Gaussian and reported it as *exact*, 12 % of
peak height off and 68 % over the real peak at its own maximum, with no
warning. ``parse_shape`` now keeps the real name (so ``is_exact`` correctly
reports it unreconstructed) and ``_raw_values`` draws it as a plain
unmodified Lorentzian of the component's own ``fwhm`` (the ``a = b = 1``,
``w = 0`` default of the LA/LF branch below, no Gaussian broadening) purely
so something renders -- not a guess at the real shape, just a placeholder
that is honestly flagged. A compound name CasaXPS writes as a base shape
followed by a second one in its own parentheses (``H(0.09,250)SGL(90)``, or
the documented ``DS(a,n)GL(m)``/``DS(a,n)SGL(m)`` blend) parses as the
leading shape with the remainder kept verbatim in ``parse_shape``'s
``suffix`` key rather than failing to parse at all; the blend itself is not
reconstructed (no real file with it has been available), so a ``DS`` with a
suffix draws as plain ``DS``, same precedent as the ``T(k)`` tail.

**DS(a, n): Doniach-Sunjic.** CasaXPS's asymmetric-tail shape for metallic /
graphitic peaks (e.g. HOPG's C 1s). Reconstructed from the published kernel
(Doniach & Sunjic 1970; the form here matches an independent reconstruction
retrieved 2026-09-26 from public papers, itself unvalidated) --
``t = 2(x-pos)/fwhm``, ``DS_raw(t; a) = cos(pi*a/2 + (1-a)*atan(t)) /
(1+4t^2)**((1-a)/2)`` -- convolved with a Gaussian through the same
``gauss_conv`` + area-normalisation pipeline LA/LF already use. This raw
kernel's own asymmetry direction is exact (a fast, power-law-t^-(2-a) decay
on the low-binding-energy side, KE > pos; the well-known long t^-(1-a) tail
on the high-BE side, KE < pos) -- only the Gaussian convolution width is a
calibration.

The convolution width uses the same ``GAUSS_K`` dial as LA/LF but, unlike
them, its own exponent on ``(25/n)`` (``GAUSS_P``, 1 for every other shape):
``gw = fwhm * GAUSS_K["DS"] * (25/n) ** GAUSS_P["DS"]``. First calibrated on
one ``DS(0.09,500)`` component (a plain ``K``, implicit exponent 1) it
overshot the real data specifically on the low-BE side once more real
``(a, n)`` variations of the *same* underlying spectrum became available
(``D:\Temp\for claude files\DS Variations.vms``: 7 CasaXPS refits of one C1s
scan, ``a`` in 0.05-0.10, ``n`` in 200/400/500) -- a symmetric Gaussian
widens a naturally sharp edge (the fast-decaying low-BE side) far more
visibly than it perturbs an already-broad tail, so too large a ``gw`` there
reads exactly as "the low-BE side extends past the data". A per-region
residual-minimising search over ``gw`` on those 7 regions showed the true
optimum scales more weakly with ``n`` than ``25/n`` (exponent 1): fitting
``gw* = fwhm * K' * (25/n)**p`` by ordinary least squares on
``log(gw*/fwhm)`` vs ``log(25/n)`` gives **``GAUSS_K["DS"] = 1.8445``,
``GAUSS_P["DS"] = 0.5737``** (R^2 = 0.886 over the 7 points -- real but
imperfect; ``a`` has a secondary effect on the true optimum, ~5.5 % relative
spread within one ``n`` group, not modelled -- a third parameter is not
worth fitting on 7 points). Against today's numbers (``K=5.6``, implicit
``p=1``) this drops the mean ``residual_rms`` across the 7 regions from
1.49 % to 1.30 % of peak height and the mean low-BE-side overshoot from
5.27 % to 3.83 % (worst case 6.68 % to 6.69 %; one region regresses
~0.03 pp, the rest improve, e.g. ``DS(0.05,200)``'s overshoot 5.68 % to
3.41 %). A ``gw`` with no ``n`` dependence at all was tried and rejected: it
removes the low-BE overshoot almost entirely but then under-broadens the
peak apex at ``n=200``, visibly worsening the whole-curve fit there --
``n`` has to stay in the formula, just with a weaker exponent. **This is
still one calibration spectrum** (now with rich ``(a, n)`` coverage rather
than one point, not an independent second measurement): retune again only
with a ``DS`` fit on genuinely different real data, not on general
principle.

numpy is needed for evaluation; everything else here is plain Python.
