"""How long an analysis took: counting time, wall-clock span and time not
spent counting.

Tk-free and numpy-free. Only what the files record is used; a number a file
does not hold is left out (``None``) rather than guessed.

* *counting time* of a region = dwell × points × scans for a scan; for a
  snapshot the energy channels are recorded in parallel, so it is
  dwell × scans. It needs the number of scans, and is ``None`` without it.
  Kratos ESCApe stores the dwell already summed over the sweeps (``dwell_total``
  in ``Region.extra``): there it is dwell × points. (Checked on 372 regions of
  four ``.experiment`` files: dwell × points is always a whole number of
  seconds, the sweep-independent per-sweep dwell is constant, and the sum over
  a group of regions fits inside the wall-clock time to the next group.)
* a *run* is one acquisition window (start, end). A file that holds several
  points or depth levels records one window for the whole run, so time is
  worked out over the distinct windows, never per point.
* *instrument in use* is the union of the runs' windows: files that overlap
  (the core levels of one depth profile are stored one file per line) are not
  counted twice, and gaps between sessions are not counted at all.
* *not counting* = instrument in use − counting time: stage moves, settling,
  autofocus, sputtering and every other overhead. It is only stated when every
  region has both its window and its counting time.

Times are ISO strings ("YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS", no zone) in ``Region.extra``
(``t_start`` / ``t_end``), with ``tz`` naming their zone when the reader knows it.
